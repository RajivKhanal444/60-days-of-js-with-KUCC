#day1 #learningwithkucc #60Daysofjs

First day of learning JavaScript under 60 Days of JS challenge by KUCC

I learnt about the workings of the web, how the browser send request to server and the background files that work for loading a website on a browser

I gained deep knowledge on how website works. As user clicks on the url the following thing happens
1. The url is resolved and the request is sent to webserver
2. In return the response is sent by webserver to the browser
3. The files are loaded and the page is displayed

This is fun to learn
