#day1 #learningwithkucc #60Daysofjs

First day of learning JavaScript
Today I learnt about the workings of the web, how the browser send request to server and the background files that work for loading a website on a browser.
The internal thing that happens when the link/url is clicked is a sequence of task done by server and browser and as follows:

1. First the url gets resolved and request is sent to the server
2. server interpets the request and sent back a response to the browser
3. Files are loaded and page is displayed

This is the first day, and I learnt about basics of web and the importance of JS for webapp.
