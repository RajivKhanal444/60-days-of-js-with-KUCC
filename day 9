Day 9 of learning javascript
Today I learnt about the concept of loops in javascript. I tried to make an application where user can search books in different shelf & add unavailable books. its working but it didn't go well.
#day9 #60DaysOfJs #learningwithkucc

code
  alert("we have 5 shelf. check all shelf books can be any where");
// alert("")

let book = prompt("Enter 2 digit book serial number");
// book=Number.parseInt(book);//changes the string input into int



let bookNO=[];
bookNO[0]="22"
bookNO[1]="11"
bookNO[2]="78"
bookNO[3]="31"
bookNO[4]="34"


for (i=0; i<=6; i++)
    {
    if (book == bookNO[i]){
        alert("checking in shelf" +i+"..."+"book found in shelf " + i);        
    }
    else{
        alert("checking in shelf" +i+"..."+"book not available in shelf " + i);
    }
}

        let newBook = prompt("book not available. do you wanna register new book: y/n");
        if(newBook=='y'){
            bookNO[5] = prompt("Enter serial no of new book");
            alert("new book registered at shelf 6" );
        }
else if(newBook=='n'){
            alert("okay. have a nice day");
        }
else{
            alert("invalid");
}
